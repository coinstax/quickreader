Welcome to QuickReader!

You are reading at 300 words per minute right now. This is a comfortable starting speed for most readers. Notice the red letter in each word? That is called the Optimal Recognition Point. Your eye naturally focuses on this spot for fastest word recognition. Keep your gaze fixed right there and let the words flow to you. Do not move your eyes. Just relax and read.

Ready to go a little faster? Here comes 350 WPM in just a moment.

Good work! You are now reading at three hundred and fifty words per minute. The words flow more quickly but your brain keeps up just fine. This is the key insight of speed reading. Your brain can process words much faster than you normally read. Trust the process and stay relaxed. Keep your eyes on that red focal point.

Now let us increase to 400 WPM and see how it feels.

Excellent! Four hundred words per minute is faster than most people read on paper. You are doing great. Notice how your eyes stay fixed in one place while words appear and disappear. There is no need to move your eyes left and right like normal reading. This saves a huge amount of time and mental effort. Keep going!

Time for 450 WPM so here we go right now.

Great job! At this speed you are reading quite fast. The key technique is to stop subvocalizing. That means stop saying the words in your head as you read them. Just see the words and understand them directly. Your brain does not need that inner voice. Let the meaning flow straight from your eyes to your understanding.

Now 500 WPM is coming up next.

Halfway to maximum speed! You are doing fantastic. Short sentences help at higher speeds. Keep your focus on the red letter. Stay relaxed. Breathe normally. Your brain is handling this easily. Trust yourself and keep reading. The more you practice this the easier it becomes over time.
